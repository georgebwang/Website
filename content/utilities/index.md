### Monash $\LaTeX$ Beamer Theme

I've written an unofficial Monash-themed $\LaTeX$ Beamer template, which can be found in its public <a href="https://github.com/georgebwang/Beamer-MonashBS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>. Click the links to see the example PDF: <a href="example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example</a>. Instructions for use are detailed on the GitHub repo page above. Enjoy!

### $\LaTeX$ Article Template

I've prepared my own template package for writing articles using $\LaTeX$, it's called `gemplate`. It has all the common packages I use, as well as other configurations such as citations using BibLaTeX, font style, and document layout. The template (`.sty` file) can be downloaded <a href="gemplate.sty" download>here</a>. To use the package, simply put `\usepackage{gemplate}` in your preamble. Click the link to see an example PDF output: <a href="test.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example</a>.
(The template is intended for the `article` document class, there is no guarantee that it will work in other document types.)
